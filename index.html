            <p id="blurb">  Growing up I always loved dogs, our family always had them and when I got older, I relished the chance to get my own. Brook (pictured) has an incredibly special energy and she's given me so much love and comfort especially during lockdown and many of my friends with pets have echoed the fact that without them the pandemic would have been even tougher. Brook gives me so much that I wanted to give something back to her and so I trained to become a Reiki Practitioner - the energy work I do with Brook and other dogs helps them if they're anxious or suffering from a whole host of other behavioural problems, I can honestly say that having had Reiki Brook is calmer and more settled than ever before! I love doing this work and I want to be able to bring my expertise and to you and your family. If you think I can help you with your dog then please do get in touch. </p>
